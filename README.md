# CSS Mini Project

Create a cheat sheet of code that is often used such as flexboxes. It has good contrastibility, making it easy to read the code snippets and titles. All code is easily highlightable and copyable so that it can be used in future references. The website itself has flexboxes which allow itself to resize itself for pleasant viewing such as on a tablet or phone.
